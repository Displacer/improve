ImProve is an imperative programming language embedded in Haskell for
high assurance applications.  ImProve uses infinite state, unbounded
model checking to verify programs adhere to specifications, which are
written in the form of assertion statements.  Yices (required) is the
backend SMT solver.


Release Notes:

0.1.5    11/23/10

- Loosened mtl requirements (mtl < 2.1).

0.1.4    11/22/10

- Bugfix: verification programming trimming: expressions in assertions in if statements not captured.
- Better annotation for assertions.

0.1.3    11/18/10

- Started state space narrowing optimizations: simple code analysis
  that reduce narrow the reachable state, thus reducing the
  number of inconclusive results.
